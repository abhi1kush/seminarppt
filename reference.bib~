abstract = {Virtualization is a hot topic in operating systems these days. It is useful in many scenarios: server consolida- tion, virtual test environments, and for Linux enthusiasts who still can not decide which distribution is best. Re- cently, hardware vendors of commodity x86 processors have added virtualization extensions to the instruction set that can be utilized to write relatively simple virtual machine monitors. The Kernel-based Virtual Machine, or kvm, is a new Linux subsystem which leverages these virtualization extensions to add a virtual machine monitor (or hyper- visor) capability to Linux. Using kvm, one can create and run multiple virtual machines. These virtual ma- chines appear as normal Linux processes and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the system.},

abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

abstract = {As Cloud computing emerges as a dominant paradigm in distributed systems, it is important to fully understand the underlying technologies that make Clouds possible. One technology, and perhaps the most important, is virtualization. Recently virtualization, through the use of hyper visors, has become widely used and well understood by many. However, there are a large spread of different hyper visors, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of some of today's commonly accepted virtualization technologies from feature comparison to performance analysis, focusing on the applicability to High Performance Computing environments using Future Grid resources. The results indicate virtualization sometimes introduces slight performance impacts depending on the hyper visor type, however the benefits of such technologies are profound and not all virtualization technologies are equal. From our experience, the KVM hyper visor is the optimal choice for supporting HPC applications within a Cloud infrastructure.},

abstract = {One of the first works, in which power management has been applied in the context of virtualized data centers. The authors have proposed an architecture of a data center’s resource management system where resource management is divided into local and global policies. At the local level the system leverages the guest OS’s power management strategies. The global manager gets the information on the current resource allocation from the local managers and applies its policy to decide whether the VM placement needs to be adapted. However, the authors have not proposed a specific policy for automatic resource management at the global level.},
